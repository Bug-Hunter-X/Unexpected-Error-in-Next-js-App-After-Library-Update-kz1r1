# Next.js Unexpected Error After Library Update

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js application after updating a third-party library.  The application initially displayed correctly, but after the update, it renders a blank page or throws a cryptic error in the browser console. The root cause is subtle and requires examining the console logs and code to pinpoint the problem.

## Problem Description

The bug manifests as a blank page or a generic error in the browser's developer console. There are no clear error messages in the Next.js terminal during the development phase, making the debugging process more challenging.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying the conflicting library or configuration and resolving it. This often involves verifying that the library is correctly installed and compatible with the current Next.js version, checking for version conflicts, or reconfiguring the library's settings.
